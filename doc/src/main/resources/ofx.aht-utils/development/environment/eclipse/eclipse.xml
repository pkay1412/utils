	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
			In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE).
			It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.
			Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications in many different programming languages.
	</ofx:paragraph>
	
	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
			The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge.
			The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes the Java development tools, is meant for Java developers.
			Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written for the Eclipse Platform,
			such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules.
			Released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, Eclipse SDK is free and open source software.

			A: Try to delete the file <text:emphasis style="typewriter">.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi</text:emphasis> in your workspace directory. Otherwise it is the best to restore the complete workspace from a backup.
